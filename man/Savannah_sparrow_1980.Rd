\description{
Point transect data collected in Colorado 1980/81 to examine effect of
agricultural practices upon avian community.
}
\details{
Design consisted of point transects placed in multiple pastures 
(3 in 1980, 4 in 1981).  While many species were observed, only data for 
Savannah sparrows (Passerculus sandwichensis) are included here.
