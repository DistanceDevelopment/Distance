Distance version 0.9.3
 * Updated tests to work with new unoque object ID code.
 * Liberally sprinkled tests with suppressMessages()

Distance version 0.9.2
 * Now warning when columns are correctly named but not in the correct case. Thanks to Richard Borthwick for reporting this bug.
 * Now checks that object IDs are unique. Thanks to Ricardo Lima & Francisco Azevedo for highlighting this issue.

Distance version 0.9.1
 * Models with both covariates and adjustment terms can actually be specified -- this was not fully implemented in previous version.
 * ds() now tells the user the models which is returned (rather than previously fitted model)
 * links to mrds documentation on optimisation issues

Distance version 0.9
 * Flat file support example, see ?flatfile
 * New data set: simulated minke whale data, see ?minke and ?flatfile for an example analysis
 * Models with both covariates and adjustment terms can be specified.
 * Default left truncation is now 0, default right truncation is now the largest observed distance or furthest bin end.

Distance version 0.8.1
 * another fix to binning (redundant code/inconsistent definition between docs and code). (Thanks to Jason Roberts for finding this.)
 * binning would fail if there were NA distances, which might occur when using the simplified data tables
 * check implemented to ensure that samples have consistent (i.e. the same) effort (Eric Rexstad found this bug)
 * clarification that stratification only occurs at the abundance/density estimation stage (dht), rather than at the detection function modelling stage (thanks to Filipe Dias for this suggestion)
 * Setting order=0 is equivalent to adjustment=NULL to specify a detection function without adjustments. (Eric Rexstad brought this to my attention.)


Distance version 0.8.0
 * new simplified table data format (see ?ds)
 * bug in binning from cutpoints (thanks to Colin Beale for finding this)
 * removed percentage truncation for binned data, as it doesn't really make sense

Distance version 0.7.4
 * new initial values argument

Distance version 0.7.3
 * remove annoying crash when mrds failed to fit a model
 * NB the optimiser underlying mrds (optimx) has changed, update both of these
    packages to avoid issues.

Distance version 0.7.2
 * message tells the user the model that was selected

Distance version 0.7.1
 * debugging options
 * bug fixes (see github for further details)
   - automatic generation of adjustments did not generate any for poly/herm.


Distance version 0.7
 * "width" is now default for scaling
