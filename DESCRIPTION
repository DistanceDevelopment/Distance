Title: A simple way to fit detection functions to distance sampling data and
    calculate abundance/density for biological populations.
LazyLoad: yes
Author: David Lawrence Miller
Description: A library that provides a simple way of fitting detection
    functions to distance sampling data for both line and point transects.
    Adjustment term selection, left and right truncation as well as
    monotonicity constraints and binning are supported. Abundance and density
    estimates can also be calculated if survey area information is provided.
