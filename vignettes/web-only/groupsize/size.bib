  abstract = {This book introduces the suite of techniques known as 'distance sampling', so-called because the common theme is the sampling of distances of objects from a line or point. The objects are usually animals or groups of animals ('clusters'), and the primary aim is to estimate their density or abundance in a survey area. In line transect sampling, the sampled distances are the shortest or perpendicular distance from a detected object to the line. It is the most widely used method for assessing the abundance of a wide range of terrestrial and marine animals. In point transect sampling, distances of detected objects from the sampled points are recorded. This book provides a comprehensive introduction to both techniques, and also describes several related techniques.'Introduction to Distance Sampling' updates the 1993 book 'Distance Sampling', which was the first, and until now, only book devoted to the topic. The book is aimed at quantitative biologists and wildlife managers, and statisticians involved in wildlife monitoring programmes. Of particular significance in this update is the chapter on study design and field methods, which has been extensively rewritten and extended. New technologies such as laser range finders, theodolites and the Geographical Positioning System (GPS) are discussed, and advice is given on a wide range of survey methods. Analysis methods have also been generalized, through the use of various types of multiplier. Many exercises have been introduced, to make the book more useful to graduate students in wildlife and conservation management.},

  abstract = {Populations of northeastern offshore spotted dolphins Stenella attenuata attenuata and eastern spinner dolphins S. longirostris orientalis have been reduced because the dolphins are bycatch in the purse-seine fishery for yellowfin tuna in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean (the `tuna\textendash{}dolphin issue'). Abundance and trends of these dolphin stocks were assessed from 12 large-scale pelagic surveys carried out between 1979 and 2000. Estimates of abundance were based on a multivariate linetransect analysis, using covariates to model the detection process and group size. Current estimates of abundance are about 640 000 northeastern offshore spotted dolphins (CV = 0.17) and 450 000 eastern spinner dolphins (CV = 0.23). For the whole period from 1979 to 2000, annual estimates of abundance ranged from 494 000 to 954 000 for northeastern offshore spotted dolphins and from 271 000 to 734 000 for eastern spinner dolphins. Management actions by USA and international fishing agencies over 3 decades have successfully reduced dolphin bycatch by 2 orders of magnitude, yet neither stock is showing clear signs of recovery. Possible reasons include underreporting of dolphin bycatch, effects of chase and encirclement on dolphin survival and reproduction, longterm changes in the ecosystem, and effects of other species on spotted and spinner dolphin population dynamics.},

  abstract = {The pooling robustness property of distance sampling results in unbiased abundance estimation even when sources of variation in detection probability are not modeled. However, this property cannot be relied upon to produce unbiased subpopulation abundance estimates when using a single pooled detection function that ignores subpopulations. We investigate by simulation the effect of differences in subpopulation detectability upon bias in subpopulation abundance estimates. We contrast subpopulation abundance estimates using a pooled detection function with estimates derived using a detection function model employing a subpopulation covariate. Using point transect survey data from a multispecies songbird study, species-specific abundance estimates are compared using pooled detection functions with and without a small number of adjustment terms, and a detection function with species as a covariate. With simulation, we demonstrate the bias of subpopulation abundance estimates when a pooled detection function is employed. The magnitude of the bias is positively related to the magnitude of disparity between the subpopulation detection functions. However, the abundance estimate for the entire population remains unbiased except when there is extreme heterogeneity in detection functions. Inclusion of a detection function model with a subpopulation covariate essentially removes the bias of the subpopulation abundance estimates. The analysis of the songbird point count surveys shows some bias in species-specific abundance estimates when a pooled detection function is used. Pooling robustness is a unique property of distance sampling, producing unbiased abundance estimates at the level of the study area even in the presence of large differences in detectability between subpopulations. In situations where subpopulation abundance estimates are required for data-poor subpopulations and where the subpopulations can be identified, we recommend the use of subpopulation as a covariate to reduce bias induced in subpopulation abundance estimates.},
