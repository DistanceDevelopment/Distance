  abstract = {This book introduces the suite of techniques known as 'distance sampling', so-called because the common theme is the sampling of distances of objects from a line or point. The objects are usually animals or groups of animals ('clusters'), and the primary aim is to estimate their density or abundance in a survey area. In line transect sampling, the sampled distances are the shortest or perpendicular distance from a detected object to the line. It is the most widely used method for assessing the abundance of a wide range of terrestrial and marine animals. In point transect sampling, distances of detected objects from the sampled points are recorded. This book provides a comprehensive introduction to both techniques, and also describes several related techniques.'Introduction to Distance Sampling' updates the 1993 book 'Distance Sampling', which was the first, and until now, only book devoted to the topic. The book is aimed at quantitative biologists and wildlife managers, and statisticians involved in wildlife monitoring programmes. Of particular significance in this update is the chapter on study design and field methods, which has been extensively rewritten and extended. New technologies such as laser range finders, theodolites and the Geographical Positioning System (GPS) are discussed, and advice is given on a wide range of survey methods. Analysis methods have also been generalized, through the use of various types of multiplier. Many exercises have been introduced, to make the book more useful to graduate students in wildlife and conservation management.},

  abstract = {Populations of northeastern offshore spotted dolphins Stenella attenuata attenuata and eastern spinner dolphins S. longirostris orientalis have been reduced because the dolphins are bycatch in the purse-seine fishery for yellowfin tuna in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean (the `tuna\textendash{}dolphin issue'). Abundance and trends of these dolphin stocks were assessed from 12 large-scale pelagic surveys carried out between 1979 and 2000. Estimates of abundance were based on a multivariate linetransect analysis, using covariates to model the detection process and group size. Current estimates of abundance are about 640 000 northeastern offshore spotted dolphins (CV = 0.17) and 450 000 eastern spinner dolphins (CV = 0.23). For the whole period from 1979 to 2000, annual estimates of abundance ranged from 494 000 to 954 000 for northeastern offshore spotted dolphins and from 271 000 to 734 000 for eastern spinner dolphins. Management actions by USA and international fishing agencies over 3 decades have successfully reduced dolphin bycatch by 2 orders of magnitude, yet neither stock is showing clear signs of recovery. Possible reasons include underreporting of dolphin bycatch, effects of chase and encirclement on dolphin survival and reproduction, longterm changes in the ecosystem, and effects of other species on spotted and spinner dolphin population dynamics.},
